# Ultimate Linux Mint 19 Cinnamon

First things First. This concept was taken from Erik Dubois
https://erikdubois.be/install-linux-mint-18-3-cinnamon-apply-ultimate-linux-mint-scripts/
Please visit his site before downloading My Repo with scripts.

It's a uniqe set of applications, modifications, network connections etc.

After installing these scripts you will arrive at a different kind of Linux Mint. Main mod for oryginal scritp is that I have done all changes for My systems not for all systems. This version is VERSION for Linux MINT 19

## Download this github

You can run any of these scripts by downloading the zip file from github. Go to the download folder and right-click to **Extract here**.
Go inside the folder and right-click <b>in a blank space</b> to go to the terminal. Now your terminal is opened in this extracted folder.

Or you can use the terminal and the git command

	sudo apt install git
	git clone https://github.com/miriampl/Ultimate-Linux-Mint-19-Cinnamon.git


## Update your system.

First update/upgrade your system with mintupdate icon at tray or use terminal command:

	sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y


## Software installation

We start the installation scripts of all the needed software via the terminal.

	./0-Clean-up-distro-specific-software.sh
	./1-install-core-software-vx.sh
	./2-install-extra-software-vx.sh
	./3-install-themes-icons-cursors-conky-plank-vx.sh
	
This is off now I till bring some specific software based on Distribution / Desktop version. FExp. "only for Linux Mint with Mate desktop."

	./4-install-distro-specific-software.sh


These three scripts will point to some of the other scripts in the folder. So keep them together.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
